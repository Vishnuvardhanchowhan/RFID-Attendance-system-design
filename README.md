# RFID-Attendance-system-design
This project is RFID based Attendance system for students with a tag, registration system for a new student, de-registration system and showing the results on LCD and our database. We have generated an automatic excel sheet which contains the timings and information about scanned tags. There are some points to improve in terms of security of our module which may be implemented as next part of the project. We have tested our project for a sample size of 20 cards and it gave accurate results for 95% of samples in registration mode. Our project is ready to implement in practical situation for a large class.
